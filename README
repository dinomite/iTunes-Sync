iTunes Sync
Drew Stephens <drew@dinomite.net>

Sync an iTunes library—music and all—from one Mac to another.  I use this to
pull all of my music from my desktop to my laptop.

This is a dead simple string of rsync commands to copy the entirety of iTunes
data files from one Mac to another.  Just give it the IP of the other Mac, and
the location of the iTunes directory on each machine.
